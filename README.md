## About
This app was created to develop my React Native skills, the main challenge was to develop an app that I would use, so I decided to create PassKeeper. Its main goal is to manage your passwords in an easy and safe way.

### Security
To keep the user's data safe, all the registered passwords are encrypted by Expo's [SecureStore](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/securestore/). The app only saves the user's password, to make them feel secure, because no e-mail or something similar is saved. No data is sent to the internet.
